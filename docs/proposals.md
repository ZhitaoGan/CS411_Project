# Proposals

## Proposal 1 - Degree Advice+

The goal of this project will be to provide students of Boston University with recommended course plans to complete their HUB requirements by integrating the user’s academic interests with BU course search and Degree Advice services. Currently, there is no mechanism for students to plan how to efficiently obtain their HUB credits in conjunction with their course requirements; due to the expansive range of courses offered and confusion surrounding HUB, even advisors are not always helpful to students. Thus, this project will utilize the student's current degree/HUB progress as well as the HUB credits associated with different courses to provide the shortest possible list(s) of classes that a student can take to graduate, possibly even with time to spare. As an added feature, we can incorporate the user’s interests outside of their major/minor requirements to match them with HUB classes that would interest them while also fulfilling their requirements. 

## Proposal 2 - Music Transfer (Apple Music/Spotify)

The goal of this project will be to streamline the transfer of music playlists between Spotify and Apple Music to allow users to access and share their playlists across distinct platforms. We will use the Spotify API to pull the songs from a playlist in Spotify, and search them on Apple Music. If the songs are available, we will organize them into a new Playlist in Apple Music with the same title and artist as the one in Spotify.

# Requirements Analysis and User Stories 3

## As a user I want to see the number of songs transferred and know which songs in my list could not be found in Apple Music.
After the transfer process, the names of the songs that were not found in Apple Music are printed out for the user to see. If all songs are found then no such message will appear. The other songs in the transfer list should be transferred as usual. The number of songs transferred will be printed as a message to the user.

# Requirements Analysis and User Stories 1

## As a user, I want to login in with my Spotify account to access playlists I previously created.
If the user is not authenticated, the user will click on the top right corner “Login” option, get redirected to the Spotify OAuth page, and log in using their Spotify account. This will allow the application to access the user’s playlists, which will be displayed on the playlist button that replaced the login button.

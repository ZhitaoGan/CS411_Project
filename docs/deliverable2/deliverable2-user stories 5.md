# Requirements Analysis and User Stories 5

## As a user, when I choose a song from a playlist I want a new tab to be created showing the Youtube video of said song. 
When the web application is running correctly it should show a user that is logged in, all of their saved playlists from Spotify. The user should also be able to see all of the songs that are present in their playlists. If a user sees a song on a playlist that he or she wishes to view, a new tab on their browser should open up a video of that song on Youtube.

# Requirements Analysis and User Stories 2

## I want the application to display the link to all my playlist songs’ music videos from YouTube all in one place.
Once the user clicks on the “Playlist” option, the user will be redirected to a new page with all playlists listed. By clicking on the “view” button underneath any of the playlists, a page will redirect and list all of the songs within the playlist. And next to each song, there will be a link for the most searched youtube video with the song name. If the login process fails at any point, an error message shall inform the user that the login has failed. Then, the user shall be prompted to attempt logging in again.

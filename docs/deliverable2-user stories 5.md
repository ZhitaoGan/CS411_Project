# Requirements Analysis and User Stories 5

## As a user, I want to be able to see which playlists I have already transferred from Spotify to Apple Music to avoid creating duplicate playlists. 
When transferring playlists, the users should be prompted with a list of historical transfers of playlists that the user has made in the past. The list should contain the name of the transferred playlist, and the metadata should include the specific song that each playlist contains. So the user will be able to avoid creating duplicate playlists. If the user is trying to transfer a playlist with the same name as an existing playlist in Apple Music, the user should be prompted to acknowledge the existence of the current playlist and decide to replace the current playlist or change the new playlist name.

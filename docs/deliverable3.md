## Frontend: 

We were deciding between React and Vue. More people on the team were familiar with React and it's highly flexible with lots of libraries, so we chose it over Vue.

Winner: React

## Backend: 

Since most people on the team are comfortable with Python, we were choosing between Django and Flask. Django is very batteries-included and has a ton of features. However, Flask is much simpler to learn and more suited to setting up a simple backend API.

Winner: Flask

## Database: 

We were deciding between MySQL and MongoDB. However, since we don't need to keep track of a lot of relationships and our API is returned to us as a JSON, MonboDB was the better choice.

Winner: MongoDB

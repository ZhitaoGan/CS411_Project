## Frontend: 

React. The framework that most people are comfortable with on the team. Highly flexible, lots of libraries.

## Backend: 

Flask. Most people on the team are comfortable with Python. It’s very easy to learn and we just need to set up a simple API.

## Database: 

MongoDB. We don’t need to keep track of too many relationships and our data comes to us as JSON.

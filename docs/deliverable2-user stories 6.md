# Requirements Analysis and User Stories 6

## As a user, I want to be able to either select the whole playlist or only certain songs to transfer to a new Apple Music playlist with the same name or straight to the Apple music library.
Once the user has logged in (story 1), they should be presented with a list of playlists in their Spotify account. They should then be able to select a playlist that they want to look at.​​ It will then display the list of songs contained in that playlist for the user to choose from. There should be a “Transfer Playlist” button that will transfer the entire playlist or “Select” option which can select only certain songs. The app should display a select mode whereby the user can check off each song that they want to transfer. The user can then click an “Export” or “Transfer” button to send the selected songs to Apple music. If only certain songs are selected, the user will be prompted to choose whether to add the songs to a new playlist in Apple music with the same name or just the Apple Music Library.

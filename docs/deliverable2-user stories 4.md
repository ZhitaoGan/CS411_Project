# Requirements Analysis and User Stories 4

## 4. As a user I want to be able to make changes to both playlists. 
After a playlist has been transferred from Spotify to Apple Music, if the user then goes on to make changes to their Spotify playlists they should have the option to update their Apple Music playlist as well with the same change. If the update fails, an error message shall inform the user that it has failed. Then, the user will be prompted to update the playlist again.

# Requirements Analysis and User Stories 1

## As a user, I want to login in with my Spotify account to allow the application to display the link to all my playlist songs’ music videos all in one place
If the user is not authenticated, the user will click on the top right corner “Login” option, get redirected to the Spotify OAuth page, and log in using their Spotify account. This will allow the application to access the user’s playlists, which will be displayed on the playlist button that replaced the login button. Once the user clicks on the “Playlist” option, the user will be redirected to a new page with all playlists listed. By clicking on the “view” button underneath any of the playlists, a page will redirect and list all of the songs within the playlist. And next to each song, there will be a link for the most searched youtube video with the song name. If the login process fails at any point, an error message shall inform the user that the login has failed. Then, the user shall be prompted to attempt logging in again.
